\details{
\strong{P-curve Analysis}

\eqn{P}-curve analysis (Simonsohn, Simmons & Nelson, 2014, 2015) has been proposed as a method
to detect \eqn{p}-hacking and publication bias in meta-analyses.

\eqn{P}-Curve assumes that publication bias
is not only generated because researchers do not publish non-significant results,
but also because analysts “play” around with their data ("\eqn{p}-hacking"; e.g., selectively removing outliers,
choosing different outcomes, controlling for different variables) until a non-significant
finding becomes significant (i.e., \eqn{p<0.05}).

The method assumes that for a specific research
question, \eqn{p}-values smaller 0.05 of included studies should follow a right-skewed distribution
if a true effect exists, even when the power in single studies was (relatively) low. Conversely,
a left-skewed \eqn{p}-value distribution indicates the presence of \eqn{p}-hacking and absence of
a true underlying effect. To control for "ambitious" \eqn{p}-hacking, \eqn{P}-curve also incorporates a
"half-curve" test (Simonsohn, Simmons & Nelson, 2014, 2015).

Simonsohn et al. (2014)
stress that \eqn{p}-curve analysis should only be used for test statistics which were actually of interest
in the context of the included study, and that a detailed table documenting the reported results
used in for the \eqn{p}-curve analysis should be created before communicating
results (\href{http://www.p-curve.com/Supplement/}{link}).

\strong{Implementation in the function}

To generate the \eqn{p}-curve and conduct the analysis, this function reuses parts of the \emph{R} code underlying
the \href{http://p-curve.com/app4/pcurve_app4.052.r}{P-curve App 4.052} (Simonsohn, 2017). The effect sizes
included in the \code{meta} object or \code{data.frame} provided for \code{x} are transformed
into \eqn{z}-values internally, which are then used to calculate {p}-values and conduct the
Stouffer and Binomial test used for the \eqn{p}-curve analysis. Interpretations of the function
concerning the presence or absence/inadequateness of evidential value are made according to the
guidelines described by Simonsohn, Simmons and Nelson (2015):

\itemize{
\item \strong{Evidential value present}: The right-skewness test is significant for the half curve with
\eqn{p<0.05} \strong{or} the \eqn{p}-value of the right-skewness test is \eqn{<0.1} for both the half and full curve.
\item \strong{Evidential value absent or inadequate}: The flatness test is \eqn{p<0.05} for the full curve
\strong{or} the flatness test for the half curve and the binomial test are \eqn{p<0.1}.
}

For effect size estimation, the \code{pcurve} function implements parts of the loss function
presented in Simonsohn, Simmons and Nelson (2014b).
The function generates a loss function for candidate effect sizes \eqn{\hat{d}}, using \eqn{D}-values in
a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as the metric of fit, and the value of \eqn{\hat{d}} which minimizes \eqn{D}
as the estimated true effect.

It is of note that a lack of robustness of \eqn{p}-curve analysis results
has been noted for meta-analyses with substantial heterogeneity (van Aert, Wicherts, & van Assen, 2016).
Following van Aert et al., adjusted effect size estimates should only be
reported and interpreted for analyses with \eqn{I^2} values below 50 percent.
A warning message is therefore printed by
the \code{pcurve} function when \code{x} is of class \code{meta} and the between-study heterogeneity
of the meta-analysis is substantial (i.e., \eqn{I^2} greater than 50 percent).
